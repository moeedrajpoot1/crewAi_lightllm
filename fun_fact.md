Okay, here are some fun facts about Lassie, the famous Collie, keeping in mind the different aspects of the character (book, TV series, and movies):

*   **A Girl Dog Played the Boy!** Almost all of the Lassies in the movies and on television were male dogs. Why? Male Collies are generally larger and have fuller coats, which looked better on camera. Also, female Collies are prone to shedding when they are in heat, and that would have been problematic for the filming schedule. The original Lassie was played by a male Collie named Pal.
*   **Lassie Started as a Short Story:** The iconic Lassie character began as a short story by Eric Knight published in 1938. It was expanded into the novel "Lassie Come-Home" in 1940, which became the basis for the famous movie and subsequent adaptations.
*   **Pal's Stunt Double Was Also His Son:** Pal, the original Lassie, had a son named Lassie Jr., who was used as a stunt double. Lassie Jr. eventually took over the role as the primary Lassie after Pal's health began to decline.
*   **Lassie Has a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame:** Lassie is one of the few animal characters to receive this honor. Her star is located at 6368 Hollywood Blvd.
*   **"Lassie Come Home" Boosted Collie Popularity:** The 1943 film "Lassie Come Home" starring Roddy McDowall and Elizabeth Taylor (in a very young role) significantly increased the popularity of Collies as pets.
*   **Lassie Has Been Owned by Children and Adults:** Depending on the adaptation, Lassie's owner has varied. Sometimes it's a young boy (like in the original story and many TV episodes), while other times it's an adult or even a whole family. This adaptability helped the character resonate with different audiences.
*   **Lassie Had a Cameo in The Simpsons:** In the Simpsons episode "Lisa's Rival", Lassie makes a brief appearance. It's a subtle nod to the character's enduring popularity in popular culture.
*   **Lassie saved many lives:** The Collie was known for saving life in her movies and TV series. It led to the creation of a real life organization named after her, Lassie Foundation. This organization helped human and animal welfare organizations.
*   **Lassie was never played by a female dog:** The reason was that male collies were bigger and looked more majestic on screen. Also, female collies shed a lot of hair when they are in heat. This would be a problem for a tight movie schedule.

I tried to add a fun fact about a city name being inspired by Lassie but I was unable to find such information. Let me know if you have any other questions!
